    <h1> This is for my coursera. don't know if it will help. </h1>
    <article>To be fair, you must have a very large iq to understand JoJo's Bizarre adventure. The humour is very subtle, and without a solid grasp of music theory and history, most of the jokes and referrences would go over your head. </article>
    <p>There's also Jotaro's burly physique, satirical of the hypermasculine physiqes of heroes of the 80's, perfectly crafted into feminine poses.</p>
    <p>The fans understand this stuff and appreciate the deeper meanings that they have about life. ABOUT LIFE!</p>

    <h2 class="bruh">As a consequence, people who don't like JoJo's truly are IDIOTS!</h2><p class="bruh"> Of course they couldn't comprehend the intricacies in, for example, Jotaro's Signature catchphrase</p>
    <h1>YARE YARE</h1>
    <p> which itself is referencing Buronson's legendary manga- 'Fist of the North Star'. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hirohiko Araki's genius wit unfolds itself in front of their eyes. What fools.. how I pity them.</p>

    <p>And yes, I DO  have a JoJo's tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid.</p>
