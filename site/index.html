      <h1> This is for my coursera. don't know if it will help. </h1>
      <article class="table-hover">To be fair, you must have a very large iq to understand JoJo's Bizarre adventure. The humour is very subtle, and without a solid grasp of music theory and history, most of the jokes and referrences would go over your head. </article>
      <p>There's also Jotaro's burly physique, satirical of the hypermasculine physiqes of heroes of the 80's, perfectly crafted into feminine poses.</p>

      <p>And yes, I DO  have a JoJo's tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
