    <h1> This is for my coursera. don't know if it will help. </h1>
    <article>To be fair, you must have a very largq iq to understand JoJo's Bizarre adventure. The humour is very subtle, and without a solid grasp of music theory and history, most of the jokes and referrences would go over your head. </article>
    <p>There's also Jotaro's burly physique, satirical of the mypermasculine physiqes of heroes of the 80's, perfectly crafted into feminine poses.</p>
    <p>The fans understand this stuff and appreciate the deeper meanings that they have about life. ABOUT LIFE!</p>

    <p> which itself is referrencing Buronson's ;egendary manga- fist of the north star.'m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.
